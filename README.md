# COVID-19-Dashboard

COVID-19 DATA ANALYSIS REPORT

This report provides an analysis of COVID-19 data using an interactive dashboard. The dashboard presents key metrics, visualizations, and filters that allow users to explore and understand the impact of COVID-19 across different countries and regions over time.

The dashboard includes the following key metrics cards:
- Total Confirmed Cases: Displays the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases globally, filtered by country/region.
- Total Deaths: Shows the total number of deaths attributed to COVID-19.
- Active Cases: Represents the number of active COVID-19 cases (calculated as total confirmed cases minus recovered cases and deaths).
- Total Recovered: Highlights the total number of patients who have recovered from COVID-19.

VISUALIZATIONS

1. Map of Confirmed Cases
 A geographical map visualizing confirmed cases across various countries/regions.
Adding Interactive tooltips display detailed information, including the number of active cases, deaths, and confirmed cases for each country.
Allows users to quickly identify hotspots and compare the spread of the virus across regions.

2. Stacked Column Chart
A column chart showing the distribution of confirmed cases, deaths, active cases, and recoveries by country/region.
This chart helps in visualizing how each category contributes to the overall COVID-19 impact per region.
Users can analyze which countries have higher death rates, more active cases, or better recovery rates.

3. Area Chart of COVID-19 Trends Over Time
An area chart representing the sum of deaths, recoveries, and confirmed cases over time.
To track the progression of the pandemic, observe trends, and identify peaks or declines in cases, recoveries, and deaths.
Highlights key periods of rapid increase or decrease, helping in correlating with interventions or other external factors.

4. Data Table with Death Rate Highlighting
A table that displays numerical values for recovered, confirmed cases, deaths, and active cases across different countries.
Death rates are highlighted in red to draw attention to regions with higher mortality.
Allows for detailed comparison of numerical data across regions.

FILTERS AND SLICERS

 WHO Region Slicer: Enables filtering of data by specific WHO regions, allowing targeted analysis.
Country/Region Slicer: Provides the ability to focus on specific countries or regions.

MULTI-ROW CARD for quick analysis 
      
      â€¢      Adding on a multi-row card which displays the top 5 countries with the highest new cases. Highlights the most affected countries in terms of recent spikes, providing a quick view of emerging hotspots.

INSIGHTS AND OBSERVATIONS

Hotspot Identification: The map and charts collectively help identify countries or regions with the highest impact.
Trend Analysis: The area chart provides insights into how the situation has evolved over time, with clear visualization of periods of improvement or deterioration.
Comparison Across Countries: The stacked column chart and table facilitate comparative analysis, highlighting areas with high recovery rates versus those with concerning death rates.
Impact of Interventions: Observations can be linked to interventions such as lockdowns, vaccination drives, and other public health measures to understand their effectiveness.

This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for monitoring and analyzing COVID-19 data, providing stakeholders with the ability to make informed decisions based on up-to-date, interactive data visualizations. The use of slicers and filters makes it adaptable to various analytical needs, offering a comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact across different regions.

RECOMMENDATIONS
- Regular updates to the data to reflect the current state of the pandemic.
- Potential enhancements could include integrating vaccination data and forecasting models to predict future trends.
